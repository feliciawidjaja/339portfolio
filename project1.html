        <h1>About the client</h1>
        <p>Established in 2020, One Iota Performance was founded by three individuals committed to empowering golf
            athletes to consistently enhance their performance. The founders' primary objective is to facilitate coaches
            and athletes in identifying optimal training areas and fostering improved communication through
            user-friendly tools and the tracking of vital golf-related data.</p>

        <h2>1. Research</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to enhance the engagement, accessibility, and efficiency of One Iota's
            performance tracking and reflection functions for competitive golfers.</p>
        <p>Golf score statistics measures a player's performance on the course, representing the number of strokes
            needed to finish a round. It enables players to track their performance over time, pinpoint areas for
            growth, and assess how they stack up against other players.
            <br><br>
            One Iota Performance tracking company currently offers website tracking platform which requires users to
            input data more likely after the game ends. The research on golf community shows 0% golfers use website for
            the purpose of scoring and analyzing data. It falls toward mobile app with more than 80% and the others
            still use paper.
        </p>

        <h1>How might we make One Iota's performance tracking and reflection function more engaging, accessible and
            efficient for competitive golfers? </h1><br>

        <h2>2. Surveys</h2>

        <p>During the initial research, we conducted an interview with a golf player who pursued to play at tournament
            and walked him through the company website. We discovered that the users of client's website do not have
            enough time to fill statistics using their computer on the course. After playing 9 or 18 holes in a round,
            they will likely forget their play performance in detail for a single hole when the game ends.</p>

        <div class="user-interview-div">
            <h1 class="user-interview-h1"><i>"The performance tracking is an important factor for competitive players to
                    reflect how they play on the course.
                    As a golfer, you tend to forget what happens when you play each hole because time limited. If you
                    want
                    to sit down after a whole 18 rounds of golf and start filling these, I'm pretty sure like a lot of
                    us
                    might forget what happened"</i></h1>
