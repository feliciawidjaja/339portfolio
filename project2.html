            <ul>
                <li>Our investigation delved into the role of smart-seeing & projecting, distributed cognition, and
                    close-coupling in shaping users' experiences across diverse gaming contexts and settings.</li>
                <li>Our research focused on the practical application of smart-seeing & projecting, distributed
                    cognition, and close-coupling within a real-life activity, proposing solutions through HCI design
                    guidelines.</li>
                <li>A preliminary Design Aid Device (DeDe) was formulated, integrating concrete evidence to effectively
                    address the effects of smart-seeing & projecting, distributed cognition, and close-coupling on the
                    field of HCI.</li>

            <h1>How might we redesign Persona 5's combat screen to enhance the gaming experience for individuals with
                dyslexia, while addressing issues of clutter, font legibility, and thematic color scheme, in order to
                improve accessibility and user control?</h1>

            <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span style="color:#8676E9">Distributed Cognition</span>
                    <span style="color:#393939"> is how information is processed between a user, other users, and within
                        the
                        systems they are using. In the case of Persona 5, it is essentially only the communication
                        between
                        the player and the game world.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span style="color:#8676E9">Smart-Seeing & Projection</span>
                    <span style="color:#393939"> is when users look at external representations to project them as
                        images
                        and draw an understanding using internal processes. In Persona 5, the game does not showcase the
                        enemy's health numbers but instead, uses a health bar in the shape of a heart to give the
                        players an
                        estimate of how much health the enemy has left.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span style="color:#8676E9">Close-Coupling</span>
                    <span style="color:#393939"> is a term for the interaction and coordination between the user and
                        computer where
                        the user demonstrates their intelligence through reasoning and the changing of information, and
                        how
                        thinking is shaped by interaction with active systems. In Persona 5 Royal, how the texts are
                        presented in the cross menu can influence the user's ability to react to the system.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Research</h2>
            <p>Dyslexia is a learning disability that affects a person's ability to read (Dorwart, n.d). It is the most
                common learning disability and the most common reason for difficulties in reading, writing, and spelling
                (Understood Team, 2022). Dyslexia often makes it harder for individuals to split words into their
                component sounds, affecting decoding skills in reading and spelling. Children with dyslexia are more
                affected by letters and digits compared to symbol strings (Ziegler et al., 2010).</p>

            <p>Dyslexia's Style Guide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use san-serif fonts so that letters appear less crowded</li>
                <li>Increase character spacing, inter-word spacing, and spacing between lines</li>
                <li>Use bold for emphasis instead of underline or italics as they cause crowding</li>
                <li>Avoid using uppercase and capital letters</li>
                <li>Avoid background patterns or pictures and distracting surroundings</li>
                <li>Use sufficient contrast between text and background, preferably dark coloured text on light (not
                    white as it might be too dazzling) background. Use cream or soft pastel colour</li>
                <li>Use white space to remove clutter near text and group-related content</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Maria Redka, a web designer from InstantShift (Redka, 2019), highlighted some other UX and UI practices
                that are helpful in addition to the above:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimize text length</li>
                <li>Use icons when possible</li>
                <li>Allow customization</li>
                <li>Use autofill and smart writing algorithms</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="purple-text"><br>Design Objective</p>
            <p>Our design objective is to <u>increase the accessibility of Persona 5's battle interface for dyslexic
                    people by reducing the screen clutter to enhance the quality of control between the user and the
                    system.</u></p>

            <p class="purple-text"><br>Research Question</p>
            <p>What features can be added to Persona 5's combat screen to improve the gaming experience for people with
                dyslexia?</p>

            <p class="purple-text"><br>Individual Research Questions</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How does Persona 5's battle interface affect smart-seeing & projecting, close-coupling, and
                    distributed cognition in dyslexic people?</li>
                <li>What are some style guides and principles that help ensure that written materials consider the
                    difficulties experienced by dyslexic people?</li>
                <li>How can we improve Persona 5's battle interface so that dyslexic people can have a better experience
                    in playing the game? What are the solutions that can help facilitate their ease of reading?</li>
                <li>What are some games that have dyslexia-friendly interfaces?</li>
            </ol>

                <div class="column2">
                    <p>We modified the switch button's shape to a consistent rectangle, enhancing its visual
                        organization. Additionally, we introduced a dedicated 'Dyslexia-Friendly Mode' button to
                        facilitate the activation of the dyslexic-friendly setting for the battle screen interface.</p>
